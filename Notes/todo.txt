FIXED BUGS:
	[x] FIX THE WEATHER TO WORK WITH A CAMERA >:( (switch from parallax scrolling to sprites)
	[x] Inventory/Status screens pause the game
	[x] Clouds are all dumb (won't follow the camera...SHADER WORKED)
	[x] FIX THE DAMN DOOR!! (Sprite issue)
	[x] Stackables won't stack or even pick up if there's another item already in inventory. (Fix is the item_name and invnetory name need to be the same, change to id system?)
	[x] Dumb double message when player hits a border... (maybe try an 'id' system? CHANGE PARENT FROM NODE TO NODE2D AND GIVE IT UNIQUE NAME)
	[x] Fix Consumable empty items to not act like you can do anything with them until filled (stackable as well...)
	[x] Show correct sprite for selected pickup (use the inventory sheet instead of tileset)
