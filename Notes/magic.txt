*** MAGIC ***
The magic system/spells for the game.

Magic System:
Magic in Taelus involves stone runes. The player must learn three Runes and combine them on a stone in order to create the spell. Then with the stone on their necklace, they can use a crystal on a wand to cast the spell. When the player has no more 'MP' or magic charge the crystal must be left alone during the day in order to recharge to cast a spell. Magic is different in this game in that it takes a lot to cast a single spell. 

Learning Magic:
The player can be born with affinities. An affinity to magic does not grant you a 'beginning spell'. It just means you have an easier time getting into the Tower of Lor to begin training to learn magic. The player must not be a wanted criminal or a notorious outlow otherwise they will be attacked by Meeker, Tulla, or Iol upon seeing them.
