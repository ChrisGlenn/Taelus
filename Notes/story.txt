*** STORY ***
This is the overall 'story' that takes place in Taelus. The main event that is setup before it happens, and
changes everything after it happens. 


Obsidius is slowly bleeding out of his magical prison in Skodia, destroying the land turning causing the desert
in the heart of Skodia to spread. Paleus, a once great king who vanished off the face of Taelus, is rumored to
return. He will be born in Gradia (in the shadow of a giant roaming beast that is gobbling up the nations) and will
face off against the darkness.


TL;DR
Paleus is swallowed by a giant sea monster. There he, and any accomplices, are inside of the giant beast for one year. After they defeat the sea-dragon Palues returns to free Skodia and is taken by The Builders to reign over Taelus.
