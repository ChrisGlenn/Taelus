The issue with spawning new trees is the position for spawning (seems to jump like crazy) and then how to respawn the tree to the new position ONCE the level disappears and then reappears (guess somehow add it to level's ready() function to spawn)


@export var will_seed = false # if the tree can seed new trees around it during Spring months	

# spawn/seed new trees
	if will_seed:
		if tree_age >= seed_age and Globals.season == 1:
			# if this tree will seed and the age hits then spawn a new tree (season must be spring)
			# start cycle thru up, right, down, left (clockwise per normal)
			var ray_direction = 0 # starts at up
			if ray_direction < 3:
				if ray_direction == 0:
					# up
					RAY.target_position = Vector2(0,-32)
					if !RAY.is_colliding():
						# spawn a new tree at this position
						var tree_baby : Node = duplicate()
						tree_baby.tree_age = 0 # it's a baby
						tree_baby.global_position = Vector2(global_position.x, global_position.y-32) # spawn above
						tree_baby.tree_id = tree_id + str(ray_direction) # create new unique ID
						tree_baby.will_seed = true # this tree will also seed
						tree_baby.seed_age = seed_age # set the same seed age
						get_parent().add_child(tree_baby)
						seed_age += 25 # increment seed_age by 25 months (2.5 years)
					else:
						ray_direction += 1 # try the next direction
				elif ray_direction == 1:
					# right
					RAY.target_position = Vector2(32,0)
					if !RAY.is_colliding():
						# spawn a new tree at this position
						seed_age += seed_age # increment by set seed_age
					else:
						ray_direction += 1 # try the next direction
				elif ray_direction == 2:
					# down
					RAY.target_position = Vector2(0,32)
					if !RAY.is_colliding():
						# spawn a new tree at this position
						seed_age += seed_age # increment by set seed_age
					else:
						ray_direction += 1 # try the next direction
				elif ray_direction == 3:
					# left
					RAY.target_position = Vector2(-32,0)
					if !RAY.is_colliding():
						# spawn a new tree at this position
						seed_age += seed_age # increment by set seed_age
					else:
						will_seed = false # the tree is blocked by all sides so stop trying to seed
